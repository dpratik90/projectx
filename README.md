ProjectX is an initiative to collect and present the best offers on the credit cards the user holds anywhere anytime. Imagine a user shopping in a shopping complex and visits a fashion store. All he has to do is check the app to get all the discounts the store is offering on the customer's credit card. While many people avail the offers to get the best deals using credit cards, most of the offers go unclaimed especially during weekdays. 

There are two crucial aspects of this application. One, the type of credit card we hold and two, the location of the customer. These aspects drive the visibility of offers best for the customer. The information is conveniently displayed over Goolge Maps.
